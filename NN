Neural networks are a good choice when the features are of simliar types. for example, all derived from the pixel of an image
and less of a good choice, when the features are of very diffrent types

control the hidden unit size and structure
alpha controls the amount of regularization that helps constrain the complexity of the model
solver: 
  is the algorithm that actually does the numerical work of finding the optimal weights
  the solver algorithms have to do a kind of hill-climbing in a very bumpy landscape with lots of local minima
