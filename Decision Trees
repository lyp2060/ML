a tree node with a lot of if-else

add feature weight
feature importance 

can control the max tree depth 

pros:
  Easily visualized and interpreted
  NO feature normalization or scaling typycally needed
  work well with datasets using a mixture of feature types
  
Cons:
  Even after tuning, decision trees can often still ovefit
  usually need an ensemble of trees for better generalization performance
  
max_depth: commonly used in practice

min_samples_leaf:
  threshold for the minimum of data instances a leaf can have to avoid further splitting
max_leaf_nodes
  limits total number of leaves in the tree
