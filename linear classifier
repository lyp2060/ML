find the one with the max-margin for classification
linear support vector machine
Regularization of SVM:
  Larger values of C: less regularization
  -fit the training data as well as possible
  -Each individual data point is important to classify correctly
 
Smaller values of C: more regularization
  - More tolerant of errors on invididual data points
  
Pros:
  Simple, Fast, scales well, 
cons:
  For lower-dimensional data, may have superior generalization performance
  for classification, data may not be linearly seperable
  
can use for multi-class classification with linear models too
  predict each one with binary models
  choose the one with highest scores
