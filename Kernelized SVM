kernelized support vector machines

Pros:
  Can perform well on a range of datasets
  Versatile: different kernel functions can be specified, or custom kernels can be defnied for specific data types
  works well for both low and high dimensional data
Cons:
  Efficiency
  Needs careful normalization of input data and parameter tuning
  does not provide direct probability estimates
  difficuilt to interpret why a prediction was made
  
Cross-Validation:
  K folds, k can be 5-10
  can provide best and worst case
  can understand how sensitive the model based on the traning data
